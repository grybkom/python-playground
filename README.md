**A Collection of Notebooks Exploring Computer Science Concepts**

Welcome to my coding playground. This is a collection of notebooks, mostly written in python, I use to better my programming skills and increase my understanding of computer science and some machine learning concepts.

## Notebooks
* **nlp_practice:** a basic breakdown of the tokenization process used in natural language processing (NLP). Text data must be converted to numerical data before it can be used in any machine learning application. This notebook is a walkthrough of this process using a single simple sentence. If you are interested in seeing a more complete application of NLP checkout my repository where NLP is used for the binary classification of tweets as disaster or non-disaster related,

* **PythonPracticeSorting:** a collection of sorting algorithms, ***Binary Insertion Sort***, ***Merge Sort***, and ***Quick Sort***, as well as some interesting implementations of these algorithms.
* **pattern_chaoticism:** an exploration of cellular automata theory. Algorithms that apply simple rules to generate new data points based their neighbors and produces visualizations of the resulting complex patterns. Some further reading on [cellular automata](https://natureofcode.com/cellular-automata/).
*  **SimpleKmeans:** this one is written in R and is a walkthrough of the K-means clustering algorithm with a simple dataset consisting of 10 data points.
